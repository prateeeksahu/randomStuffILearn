 These notes are created while learning git commands from GIT documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. git switch<args>
	
	new version of got checkout	

	given $ git switch -c new v2.6.13 command

	'switch' switches to new branch we are about to create
	-c creates the new branch
	'new' is the new branch name
	'v2.6.13' is the tag given to that commit

	so it creates a new branch of given tag and switches to it... or checkouts to it

	intrestingly if you pass --detach with a commit or a tag now your head is at tag and not on branch... now you can make a changes here and make a new commit


$ git tag -l

	this command will show us all the tags tagged to any commit

$ git reset --hard v2.6.17

	this command will reset the current directory to specified tag, revert the changes to that commit

$ git show

	this command shows the most recent commit information
