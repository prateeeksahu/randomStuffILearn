-> a class can be inherited using extends keyword

-> while calling a constructor of child class if we want to initialize values both parent class and child we call parent constructor of parent class inside the child class constructor.

public boxWeight(double l, double h, double w, double wt) {
        super(l, h, w); // super represents parent class constructor and setting the value
        this.wt = wt;
    }

-> child will not be able to access the private data members or methods from parent if they are declared private in parent class

-> you can a refernce variable of type parent and it can point to obj of type child 

Box box = new boxChild();

but the box cannot access any data members or methods that is inside the child class

but child obj can access all data members or methods of parent class

simple words parent obj cannot access aything from child but child can access anything for parent AND

type of reference variable decides what data mambers that obj can access

-> now we cannot make a object an obj of parent and reference variable of child, because we while creating obj we need to initialise variable of child class as well

and those extra variables that are not present in parent can not be initialised using using parent constrctor

-> you can create an obj of type child and a reference of type parent can ppoint to it,  

ln/lk

-> super keyword refers constructor of parent class, and if you write super keyword with variable name it will refer to parent class variable

-> multiple inheritance is not allowed in java, but overcome this we have interfaces in java
