-> class is just a template that do  not really exist. instance is its physical incarnation which we call object. 

-> instance variable is the variable present inside the instance of class

-> a dot operater (.) is used to access instance variables and functions of a class. It is also called as seprater

->The 'new' keyword dynamically allocates(that is, allocates at run time)memory for an object & returns a reference to it. This reference is, more or less, the address in memory of the object allocated by new. This reference is then stored in the variable. Thus, in Java, all class objects must be dynamically allocated.

-> static variables or functions do not belong to obj. They can be used even if obj is not created. so if i make a counter that keeps track of how many objs are created i will make a static variable inside the class and increment it every time the constructer is called.

then to check how many obj were created i will just access that varible using classname or obj name ex -> class_name.counter or obj.counter.

-> static data members can only have static data members. because main is static we can only use static class or methods inside it. 

-> To use non static things in main what you can do is make the obj of class you are inside and add obj.staticthing while using it.

public class Main{

	public static void main(String [] args){
		
		Main obj = new Main();
		obj.greet(); // here greet cannot be used as it is not static and is being inside main method which is static. So I made obj of Main class	

		}

		void greet(){
		
		System.out,println("Hello");

		}

}

-> main method is static because to use any thing that is inside the class we have to make its obj first. and because static thing do not belong to obj nut to class main method can be used.
